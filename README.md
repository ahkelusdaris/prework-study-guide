# Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to build my first webpage and this has been done by building a Prework Study Guide. This will be helpful to get some understanding of the basics in order to feel prepared for the upcoming front-end development bootcamp! 


## Usage

You will gain access to the notes in each section of this guide by right clicking on the browser and clicking 'Inspect'. This will enable access to the Chrome DevTools and the console tab which will show you a list of topics along with a suggestion on what to study first.
